LAURENCE says: Once our agent has a list of websites to visit, it needs to be able to parse the content of those websites and extract the relevant information. This is where the next prompt comes in.

(Open Concierge_agent_step5--add prompt2 (line 205). Call Ollama with it)

The previous step gave us a list of URLs, but we want to be intelligent about the ones we use, so Gemma will reflect on them to come up with a condensed set that looks closer to the user's goals.

We pass it to gemma, and get the response.

We can now work with that list of URLS.

Earlier we created the tool to browse websites. 

So let's go through our list of sites, one by one, and browse them. We'll aggregate the text we get back from them. We can use that in the next step!

This is a relatively simple prompt, but it's a very important one. The quality of the text that we extract from the websites will have a big impact on the quality of the final summary that our agent generates.
