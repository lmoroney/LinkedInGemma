LAURENCE says: Alright, it's time to start building our concierge agent! In this chapter, we're going to put all of the pieces together that we've learned about so far.

(Show a flowchart of the application architecture)[Chapter2-2.mermaid will do]

We'll start by creating a new Python file called `concierge_agent.py`. In this file, we'll define the main function that will drive our agent. This function will take the user's request as input and then execute the agentic workflow.

Next, we'll stub out the functions for each step in the workflow.

We'll also define the tools that our agent will use: `search`, `browse`, and `email`.

In the next few videos, we'll fill in the details for each of these functions and get our agent up and running.
