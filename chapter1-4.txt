LAURENCE says: Alright, it's time to write our first "Hello World" application with Gemma 3! We're going to write a simple Python script that sends a prompt to the Ollama server and prints the response.

As you can see, it's a pretty simple script. We're using the `requests` library to send a POST request to the Ollama server. The prompt is "Why is the sky blue!".

Let's run this script and see what happens.

As you can see, the model has responded with lots of great information. This is just a simple example, but it shows how easy it is to get started with Gemma 3 and Ollama.

In the next chapter, we'll start building our concierge agent. This is where the real fun begins!
