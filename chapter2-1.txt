LAURENCE says: So, what exactly is an agent? In the context of AI, an agent is a system that can perceive its environment, reason about its observations, and take actions to achieve its goals.

You can think of an agent as a little robot that lives inside your computer. You give it a task, and it goes off and does it for you. It can use tools to help it along the way, and it can learn from its experiences to get better over time.

In this chapter, we're going to build a simple agent that can search the web for something you need, browse the websites it finds to glean information from them, it will then summarize the relevant information, and send you an email with the summary. 

We'll break down the agentic workflow into three main steps: Plan, Execute, and Reflect.

This is a very powerful paradigm, and it's one that's becoming increasingly popular in the world of AI. By the end of this chapter, you'll have a solid understanding of how agents work.
