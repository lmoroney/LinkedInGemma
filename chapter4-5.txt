LAURENCE says: The final prompt in our agent is the one that decides whether or not to email the results to the user. This is a great example of how we can use Gemma 3 as a decision-making engine.

[Go to the prompt where 'Your task is to decide if an email is...']

This prompt takes the user's original request and the summarized results as input and asks Gemma 3 to make a simple "yes" or "no" decision. We'll also ask it to generate a new email from the summarized results if the decision is "yes".

[Working in concierge_agent_step5.py, paste in code from concierge_agent.py -- The email decision prompt. Also show the few shot learning witht he example in the prompt]

This is a powerful technique that can be used to add a layer of intelligence to any application.

If Gemma decided that an email is appropriate -- it will run this code (type in the tool part where we send an email with SMTP and talk through it)

...and our agent is now done!

In the next chapter, we'll recap the entire agentic workflow and then finish up the code for our concierge agent.
