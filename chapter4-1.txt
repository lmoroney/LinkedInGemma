LAURENCE says: Now that we have the basic architecture of our agent in place, let's recap how everything works together.

(Show a diagram of the application architecture, highlighting the flow of data)[Chapter2-2.mermaid]

The user's request comes in and is first processed by the `plan` part of the pattern where it is parsed for intent. 

This function uses Gemma 3 to generate a search query.

THe serach query is executed using the search web tool. 

Gemma 3 then reflects on the results, and derives a list of 'good urls'

The agent then takes action by browsing the sites and gleaning information from them.

Gemma 3 reflects of these results, summarizing them for useful content that matches the users intent

And if appropriate that summary is emailed to the user.

Planning. Executing. Reflecting. The three steps of an agentic workflow. 

The key to making this workflow truly intelligent is the prompt engineering that we use to interact with Gemma 3.

In the next few videos, we'll dive deep into the prompts that we're using for each step of the workflow.
