LAURENCE says: We've successfully integrated multi-modal capabilities into our agent, but there's always room for improvement. Particularly when a lot of your code is based on prompting.

I have found that using an LLM to make prompts to other LLMs more efficient is a very effective way of experimenting

So, I worked with Gemini with a prompt like this:

>>can you now look at concierge_agent_multimodal.py and suggest improvements to tweak the various prompts to improve performance. Output your recommendations to a new concierge_agent_multimodal_tweaks.py

And the results I got looked like this:

(Use FileMerge to show them and discuss more advanced prompting -- in particular encourage them to test and experiment constantly)

By experimenting with different prompts, we can unlock the full potential of Gemma 3 and create agents that are truly amazing. The only limit is your imagination!
