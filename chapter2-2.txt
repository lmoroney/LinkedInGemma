LAURENCE says: The first step in the agentic workflow is to create a plan. This is where the agent takes the user's request and turns it into a series of actions that it can take to fulfill that request.

In our concierge agent, we're following a static workflow where the processing is handled by Gemma 3. 

The user will give the agent a request, and we'll give Gemma a prompt that describes the user's request, and we'll ask it to perform the first step of the plan -- to search the web for results.

For example, if the user asks our agent to "find the best japanese restaurants in my neighborhood", Gemma will be prompted like this, and come up with a tool use plan for the results like this:

This will be the first step of the agentic flow you can see here. [Chapter2-2.mermaid]

This plan gets broken down into a set of steps, where we are either having Gemma aritificially understand the data on our behalf, or using the tools to get further data. 

In the next video, we'll take a look the tools that it uses.
