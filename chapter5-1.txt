LAURENCE says: We've covered a lot of ground in this course. We've learned about Gemma 3, Ollama, and the agentic workflow. We've also built a set of tools that our agent can use to interact with the world.

Let's take a moment to recap the entire flow of our application.

1.  The user's request comes in and is processed by the `plan` function.
2.  The `execute` function carries out the commands from the plan, using our tools.
3.  The `reflect` function uses Gemma 3 to analyze the results and generate a final response.

This is a powerful and flexible architecture that can be used to build a wide variety of agents.

In the next video, we'll finish up the code for our concierge agent and see it in action.
