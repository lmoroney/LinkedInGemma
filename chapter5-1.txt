LAURENCE says: We've covered a lot of ground in this course. We've learned about Gemma 3, Ollama, and the agentic workflow. We've also built a set of tools that our agent can use to interact with the world.

Let's take a moment to recap the entire flow of our application.

Through the lens of plan/execute/reflect, we can see how this agent is a workflow through multiple processes.

Starting with the user's intent. Gemma begins the process of planning what to do with it -- getting their intent, and whether or not there was an email address in there. It then executed a web search to get results. It then reflected on those results for appropriateness before the next step.

Where it planned what to do with those results -- filtering them for appropriateness before taking the action of browsing the sites, and reflecting on the results, again filtering for appropriateness, and fact checking etc. before summarizing them.

This data was then subject to another plan -- should be be emailed to the user or not? Gemma's opinion on that then triggers the final execution -- to craft the email and send it. 

This is a powerful and flexible architecture that can be used to build a wide variety of agents.

In the next video, we'll finish up the code for our concierge agent and see it in action.
