LAURENCE says: And that's a wrap! We've covered a huge amount of ground in this course. We've learned about Gemma 3, Ollama, and the agentic workflow. We've built a powerful concierge agent that can search the web, browse websites, and send emails. And we've even extended our agent to be multi-modal.

I hope you've enjoyed this journey as much as I have. The world of AI is moving at an incredible pace, and I'm so excited to see what you'll build with the skills that you've learned in this course.

The future is in your hands. Go out there and build something amazing!
