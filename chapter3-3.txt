LAURENCE says: The next tool that we'll create for our agent is the browse tool. This tool will allow our agent to browse a specific website and extract its contents.

Previously we saw the tool that the agent could use to get a list of web sites. It will decide on the best ones, and then pass them to this site one by one.

Let's look at the function:

(go to browse_website in concierge_agent_step2.py)

We'll use the `requests` library again to download the HTML of a website. Then, we'll use the `BeautifulSoup` library to parse the HTML and extract the text.

[Show code from concierge_agent_step2.py -- The browse tool]

The `browse` function takes a URL as an argument and returns the text content of the page. 

Let's implement this (talk through adding code from concierge_agent_step3.py)

We'll also add some error handling to make sure that our agent can handle cases where the website is unavailable.

Once we have the browse tool implemented, it's ready for the agent to use. We'll implement that in the run_concierge_agent method later.

In the next video, we'll create the email tool.
