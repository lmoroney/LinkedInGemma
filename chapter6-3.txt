LAURENCE says: Now that we have a text description of the image, we need to integrate it into our agentic workflow. We can do this by updating the `plan` function to take the image description as an additional input.

The updated `plan` function will now take both the user's text request and the image description as input. It will then use Gemma 3 to generate a plan that takes both of these inputs into account.

For example, if the user drags an image of sushi onto the terminal and asks "where can I get this?", the agent is now able to use the information from the image to generate a more relevant and useful plan.

In the next video, we'll look at how we can tweak the prompt to further refine the performance of our multi-modal agent.
